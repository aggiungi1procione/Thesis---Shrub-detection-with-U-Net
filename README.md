The description of files:
1. tif_to_png.py  -   Python code for bulk conversion of image files in TIF format to PNG format. The second part of the code is the 'slicing' (tiling) algorithm that I used for slicing of the big PNG images into smaller (800 x 800) px tiles. This algorithm was subsequently used also for slicing (100 x 100) px, (200 x 200) px, (300 x 300) px, (400 x 400) px and (500 x 500) px patches from the (800 x 800) px tiles.
